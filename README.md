# USA_NonImmigrant_Visa

**Project Overview:** This project focuses on analyzing trends in USA non-immigrant visas and building predictive models to forecast future visa patterns. By leveraging historical visa data, the goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing visa issuance and predict future visa trends for non-immigrants traveling to the United States.

**Key Features:**

_Data Analysis:_ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on non-immigrant visa data, along with the H1b approvals data to identify key trends such as visa types, country of origin, and year-over-year changes.
_Predictive Modeling:_ Implement time-series machine learning models to predict future visa issuances based on historical data, using features such as application trends, economic indicators, and policy changes.
_Visualization:_ Create interactive visualizations to display key trends and predictions, making the data more accessible for interpretation.

**Project Goals:**

1. Analyze historical non-immigrant visa data to uncover patterns.
2. Build machine learning models to predict future visa trends.
3. Provide a data story explaining the visa issuances.

**Technologies Used:**

Python: For data analysis and machine learning.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: To develop predictive models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and trend analysis.
